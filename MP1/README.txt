This program should be run in a Python IDE, ensuring that you have downloaded the text file "JalopnikTitles" so that the program is able to pull the text it needs to run. Also ensure that both collections and pattern have been imported before trying to run the file. Regarding the output, titles are listed and then organized by manufacturer from the lists of specified manufactuers in the dictionary. From there, each manufacturer has been sorted into positive and negative titles provided they contain certain words deemed as such. Lastly, the single numerical value beneath each output line in the positive or negative section is the value that the pattern sentiment analysis package assigns to each title based on the wording. One can then compare the two based on numerical value and sorting location
